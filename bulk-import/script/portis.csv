Getting Started With Portis,https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010466899-Getting-Started-With-Portis,1 month ago,"<div class=""article-body""><h2><strong>What is Portis?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span>Portis is the first compatible software wallet with the New ShapeShift Platform! A software wallet is a more convenient way of storing your crypto assets. While hardware wallets, such as KeepKey, are more secure, wallets like Portis have no cost barrier of entry, do not require a physical device, and can be logged into from any machine (as long as you remember your password)!</span></p>
<h2><strong>How Do I Create a Portis Wallet?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span>Getting your wallet setup to use takes no longer than five minutes. To start, head to beta.shapeshift.com. If you have not connected a wallet previously, the dashboard should prompt you to “Create or connect a wallet”. Next to Portis, click “Select”.</span></p>

I Need Help With My Portis Password/Recovery Sentence.,https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010358680-I-Need-Help-With-My-Portis-Password-Recovery-Sentence-,2 months ago,"<div class=""article-body""><p><span>When registering a Portis account, you create a wallet, which is immediately encrypted client-side with a secret that was generated from your password. This password never leaves your device. The Portis servers safeguard only user-encrypted wallets, so you can rest assured that nobody but you can access your wallet or sign any transactions without your consent. However, because the private key used to encrypt your recovery phrase is derived from the password you pick, if you lose your password <strong>and</strong> recovery phrase, your funds are lost forever.&nbsp;</span><span>As long as you have access to either, you have control of your funds!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So please - log in and back up that phrase somewhere safe. It is your only way to reset your password in case you forget it.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How Do I See My Recovery Sentence?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Once you’re connected to your Portis wallet, head to the “Settings” tab of the platform: </span><strong><a href=""https://beta.shapeshift.com/settings"">https://beta.shapeshift.com/settings</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Click the drop-down arrow.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>You will be redirected to: </span><strong><a href=""https://wallet.portis.io/recovery-phrase"">https://wallet.portis.io/recovery-phrase</a></strong><span> where your recovery sentence is visible.

<p><strong>In the event that you forget/lose your password, you’ll need both the email address associated with your account as well as your recovery sentence.</strong></p>
<p><span>For more settings, visit </span><a href=""https://wallet.portis.io/""><span><strong>wallet.portis.io</strong></span></a><span>. From there you can enable/disable 2FA, change password, view recovery phrase, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
